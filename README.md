# Docker Service Management with Overlay Networks

This repository demonstrates the use of Docker commands to create and manage services using overlay networks. It showcases how to constrain services to specific nodes, scale services, update them, and manage rolling updates effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on all nodes.
- Docker Swarm mode initialized.
- Nodes properly configured and joined to the Docker Swarm cluster.

---

## Commands Breakdown

### 1. Create an Overlay Network
```bash
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable my-overlay
```
- **Description**: Creates an attachable overlay network named `my-overlay`. Overlay networks enable communication between containers across multiple nodes in a Swarm cluster.
- **Options**:
  - `--driver overlay`: Specifies the overlay network driver.
  - `--attachable`: Allows standalone containers to connect to this network.

---

### 2. Create a Service
```bash
docker service create --name firefly -p 80:80 --network my-overlay --replicas 5 --constraint node.hostname==node1 bretfisher/browncoat:v1
```
- **Description**: Deploys a service named `firefly` with the following properties:
  - **Image**: `bretfisher/browncoat:v1`
  - **Replicas**: 5 instances.
  - **Port Mapping**: Maps port `80` on the host to port `80` on the container.
  - **Network**: Connects the service to the `my-overlay` network.
  - **Constraint**: Ensures that all service replicas are deployed only on the node with hostname `node1`.

---

### 3. Update Service with Monitoring
```bash
docker service update --update-monitor 15s firefly
```
- **Description**: Updates the `firefly` service with a 15-second monitoring interval before proceeding to the next task in the update process. This ensures smoother updates and avoids cascading failures.

---

### 4. Inspect the Service
```bash
docker service inspect --pretty firefly
```
- **Description**: Provides detailed information about the `firefly` service in a human-readable format.

---

### 5. Scale the Service
```bash
docker service scale firefly=15
```
- **Description**: Scales the `firefly` service to 15 replicas. Scaling adjusts the number of containers running for the service dynamically.

---

### 6. Update Service with Parallelism
```bash
docker service update --force --update-parallelism 5 --force firefly
```
- **Description**: Updates the `firefly` service while:
  - Forcing the update without any changes to the image or configuration.
  - Processing updates in batches of 5 containers at a time to ensure controlled rollouts.

---

### 7. Update with "Start-First" Strategy
```bash
docker service update --update-order start-first --force firefly
```
- **Description**: Updates the `firefly` service using the **start-first** update order. This ensures:
  - New containers are started and running before old ones are stopped.
  - Minimal downtime for the service during updates.

---

### 8. Scale Down the Service
```bash
docker service scale firefly=1
```
- **Description**: Reduces the number of replicas for the `firefly` service to a single instance.

---

## Use Cases

- **High Availability**: Scale services to handle increased traffic.
- **Controlled Updates**: Use update strategies to minimize service downtime and ensure smooth rollouts.
- **Node-Specific Deployments**: Use constraints to deploy services to specific nodes in the cluster.

---

## Monitoring and Management

- Use `docker service ls` to list running services.
- Use `docker service ps firefly` to view the tasks associated with the `firefly` service.
- Use `docker service logs firefly` to view logs for the `firefly` service.
